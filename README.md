# weekend-redux-feedback loop

## Description

Duration: 4 day sprint

We were tasked with creating an application that would track daily feedback from students. The application collects information about how students feel, checks their understanding, determines if they feel supported by the program, and, if they like, students may also leave comments to provide specific details. 

## Installation

1. Create a database named prime_feedback,
2. The queries in the data.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5. Run npm run client in your terminal
6. The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage
1. Begin with the first question about how you are feeling. Select a number between 1-5. Click the Next button.
2. A rating for the first three questions must be provided. 
3. If you would like to provide details complete the comments section. 
4. Once the questions have been answered you can review your feedback before submission. 
5. If you would like to change your information click the Back button. Click Submit if you are satisfied with your response. 
6. You will receive a confirmation of the submission. You will also receive an option to leave new feedback.
